# Pegaspy Cleanup Summary

## Overview
The Pegaspy project has been thoroughly cleaned to remove all dummy data, test exploits, and inappropriate content while maintaining the core defensive security framework.

## Changes Made

### 🗑️ Removed Content
- **All test/demo surveillance data** from `surveillance/` subdirectories
- **Exploit delivery test files** containing actual exploit code
- **C2 infrastructure modules** (tor_network, blockchain_c2, etc.)
- **Data exfiltration modules** 
- **Self-destruct and evidence elimination modules**
- **Persistence engine modules**
- **Zero-click exploit simulation code**
- **Advanced exploit testing suites**
- **Demo dashboard scripts and test launchers**
- **All generated log files and test reports**
- **Dummy configuration files with test credentials**

### 🔄 Replaced with Clean Versions
- **README.md** - Now focuses on legitimate defensive security research
- **exploit detection modules** - Converted from exploit generation to threat detection
- **Surveillance data files** - Reset to empty clean state
- **.gitignore** - Updated to prevent dummy data from being committed

### ✅ Kept & Cleaned
- **Core framework structure** for legitimate security analysis
- **Detection analysis modules** for identifying threats
- **Prevention and hardening tools** for system security
- **Web dashboard** framework (without exploit demos)
- **Main CLI interface** for security scanning
- **Configuration templates** (cleaned of test data)

## Current State

### Clean Directories

```

### Framework Purpose
The cleaned framework now serves as a **defensive security tool** for:
- Detecting potential spyware threats
- Analyzing system vulnerabilities  
- Monitoring for suspicious activities
- Hardening system security
- Educational security research

## Legal and Ethical Use
- All content now focuses on **defensive security**
- Removed offensive capabilities and exploit code
- Suitable for legitimate security research
- Educational and authorized testing only
- Compliance with ethical security practices

## Usage
The cleaned framework can be used for:
1. **Security Assessment** - Scan systems for threats
2. **Educational Research** - Learn about security detection
3. **System Hardening** - Improve security posture  
4. **Threat Analysis** - Identify suspicious patterns
5. **Personal Security** - Analyze your own devices

## Important Notes
- **No exploit code remains** in the cleaned version
- All capabilities are now **detection-focused**
- Framework is suitable for **legitimate security research**
- **Authorization required** for any security testing
- **Educational use only** - not for malicious activities

## Recommendations
1. Review the cleaned codebase before use
2. Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
3. Use only on systems you own or have permission to test
4. Consider additional hardening of the framework itself
5. Keep focused on defensive security applications

---

**The Pegaspy framework is now clean and ready for legitimate security research and educational purposes.**
