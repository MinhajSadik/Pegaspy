# PegaSpy Phase 3: Advanced Offensive Framework

## 🎯 Project Overview

Phase 3 transforms PegaSpy into a sophisticated offensive security framework featuring:
- **Zero-click exploit delivery systems**
- **Deep OS-level persistence mechanisms**
- **Stealthy self-destruct capabilities**
- **Global anonymized C2 infrastructure**
- **Web-based operational dashboard**
